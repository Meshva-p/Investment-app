# Investment-app
This AI-powered stock prediction app combines deep learning and large language models (LLMs) to deliver actionable financial insights. An LSTM model forecasts future stock prices based on historical data, while Google RSS feeds provide the latest news, which the LLM analyzes for key points and sentiment. Built with Streamlit, the app lets users select stocks, view dynamic predictions, and access AI-generated news summariesâ€”combining quantitative forecasting with qualitative analysis for informed investment decisions.
